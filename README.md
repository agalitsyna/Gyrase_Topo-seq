# Gyrase_Topo-seq
Exploring gyrase cleavage sites accross E. coli W3110 genome

DNA-gyrase is a type II topoisomerase that introduces negative superhelicity into topologically closed DNA molecules. It operates with two DNA segments - so called G and T. During catalysis the enzyme introduces temporal double-stranded break into the G-segment, transferres the T-segment through it and religates the gap. The 5'-ends of the DNA break are stabilized by the formation of the intermediate covalent complex between DNA and gyrase.
Topo-Seq is a ChIP-Seq-like approach that exploits the formation the complexes to map the gyrase cleavage sites with a single-base precision.

This repositorium contains a set of bash, python and R scripts that were used for Topo-Seq data analysis and visualization.
